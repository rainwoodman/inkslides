Making Slides with Inkscape

To install, copy all files in extensions directory to
~/.config/inkscape/extensions

Tutorial: see inkslides.svg

A lot of inspiration is from Sozi (sozi.baierouge.fr). Both define slide pages with rect elements, 
and switch between pages via SVG transformations.

Differences:
 
 * inkslides orders slides with a path; 
   sozi has a user interface.
 * inkslides has no animation (may add panning / zooming later); 
   sozi is mainly for animations
 * inkslides treats all layers but the control layer the same way; 
   sozi can move different layers differently
